# Using OpenCV and Haar Cascades to make people feel watched!

## Hardware Requirements.

It is assumed that you have already built the animatronic head, shown elsewhere in this repository and got it all working. Hopefully you had to do less faffing than I did. 

It may be prudent to install the .ino file included in this directory. Any changes made to the arduino firmware that help will be saved there.

## Software Starting Points.

This code will basically be a refactoring of the main.py code in the AnimatronicHead-Puppt directory. However there will be the addition of code to implement body and face detection using OpenCV and the haarCascades functionality
